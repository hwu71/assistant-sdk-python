# Google Assistant with Face Recognition Trigger Support


## Description:

We forked the open-source assistant-sdk-python project and extended it to enable users to trigger face recognition of the DIY Mirror using voice command.


## Execution:
```sh
cd google-assistant-sdk/googlesamples/assistant/grpc
. my_import.sh
python pushtotalk.py
```


## Usage:
Before interaction with Google Assistant, press "enter" key in the command line window. Then speak "Talk to DIY Mirror" and "Face Recognition" in turn to trigger the Python script for face recognition.
